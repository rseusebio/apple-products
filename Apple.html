                The Apple Computer 1, originally released as the Apple Computer and known later as the Apple I,
                or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976.
                It was designed by Steve Wozniak. The idea of selling the computer came from Wozniak's friend and
                co-founder Steve Jobs. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold
                his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars (Wozniak later
                said that Jobs planned instead to use his bicycle to get around), and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator
                for $500.
                Wozniak demonstrated the first prototype in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto,
                California.

                The Apple II (stylized as apple ][) is an 8-bit home computer and one of the world's first highly
                successful
                mass-produced microcomputer products. It was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak; Steve Jobs oversaw the
                development of Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.
                It was introduced by Jobs and Wozniak at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, and marks Apple's first
                launch of
                a personal computer aimed at a consumer market—branded toward American households rather than
                businessmen or computer hobbyists.
